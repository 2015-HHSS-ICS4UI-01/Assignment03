A3Q2: Bubble Sort
[25, 30, 20, 80, 40, 60]
Bubble Sort will begin at the beginning of the array. It will compare the number in the position to the 
number in the position next to it. If the number is bigger than the number beside it, it will switch the number.

Start at the beginning of the array. 
Is 25 greater than 30? No. Go to the next spot in the array.
Is 30 greater than 20? Yes. Switch the position of the two numbers.
Is 30 greater than 80? No. Go to the next spot in the array.
Is 80 greater than 40? Yes. Switch the position of the two numbers.
Is 80 greater than 60? Yes. Switch the position of the two numbers.
The loop restarts.
