Array = {25, 30, 20, 80, 40, 60}

BubbleSort starts at position 0 of an array and compares the next number to it, and switches the numbers depending on if the number are smaller or bigger.


    Position 0 = 25.

    Is 25 greater than 30? No. Go to the next spot in the array.
    Is 30 greater than 20? Yes. Switch the position of the two numbers.
    Is 30 greater than 80? No. Go to the next spot in the array.
    Is 80 greater than 40? Yes. Switch the position of the two numbers.
    Is 80 greater than 60? Yes. Switch the position of the two numbers.
    
    Since switch was made in the previous run the loop will restart.
    Position 0 = 25.
    Changed Array = {25, 20, 30, 40, 60, 80}
    
    Is 25 greater than 30? Yes. Switch the position of the two numbers.
    Is 25 greater than 30? No. Go to the next spot in the array.
    Is 30 greater than 40? No. Go to the next spot in the array.
    Is 40 greater than 60? No. Go to the next spot in the array.
    Is 60 greater than 80? No. Go to the next spot in the array.
    
    Since switch was made in the previous run the loop will restart.
    Position 0 = 25.
    Changed Array = {20, 25, 30, 40, 60, 80}

    Is 20 greater than 25? No. Go to the next spot in the array.
    Is 25 greater than 30? No. Go to the next spot in the array.
    Is 30 greater than 40? No. Go to the next spot in the array.
    Is 40 greater than 60? No. Go to the next spot in the array.
    Is 60 greater than 80? No. Go to the next spot in the array.

    Since no switches were made the loop does not start and means the numbers are sorted.
