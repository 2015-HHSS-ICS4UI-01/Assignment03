Trace through the execution of Bubble Sort as it sorts through the following array in ascending order:  20  25  30  40  60  80

First pass:
Look at the first two numbers, "25" and "30". Check to see what number is bigger.
Because the first number in the pair "25" is smaller than "30", do not swap them.
Now look at the next pair of numbers, which is "30" and "20". Check to see what number is bigger.
Because the first number in the pair "30" is bigger than "20", swap their positions in the array.
Now look at the next pair of numbers, which is "30" and "80". Check to see what number is bigger.
Because the first number in the pair "30" is smaller than "80", do not swap them.
Now look at the next pair of numbers, which is "80" and "40". Check to see what number is bigger.
Because the first number in the pair "80" is bigger than "40", swap their positions in the array.
Now look at the next pair of numbers, which is "80" and "60". Check to see what number is bigger.
Because the first number in the pair "80" is bigger than "60", swap their positions in the array.
We have reached the final position in the array, so we know for sure that it contains the largest number.

Second pass:
Again, look at the first two numbers, "25" and "20". Check to see what number is bigger.
Because the first number in the pair "25" is bigger than "20", swap their positions in the array.
Now look at the next pair of numbers, which is "25" and "30". Check to see what number is bigger.
Because the first number in the pair "25" is smaller than "30", do not swap them.
Now look at the next pair of numbers, which is "30" and "40". Check to see what number is bigger.
Because the first number in the pair "30" is smaller than "40", do not swap them.
Now look at the next pair of numbers, which is "40" and "60". Check to see what number is bigger.
Because the first number in the pair "40" is smaller than "60", do not swap them.
Now look at the next pair of numbers, which is "60" and "80". Check to see what number is bigger.
Because the first number in the pair "60" is smaller than "80", do not swap them.
We have reached the final position in the array, but a swap was made in that pass, so we must pass again.

Third Pass:
Now look at the next pair of numbers, which is "20" and "25". Check to see what number is bigger.
Because the first number in the pair "20" is smaller than "25", do not swap them.
Now look at the next pair of numbers, which is "25" and "30". Check to see what number is bigger.
Because the first number in the pair "25" is smaller than "30", do not swap them.
Now look at the next pair of numbers, which is "30" and "40". Check to see what number is bigger.
Because the first number in the pair "30" is smaller than "40", do not swap them.
Now look at the next pair of numbers, which is "40" and "60". Check to see what number is bigger.
Because the first number in the pair "40" is smaller than "60", do not swap them.
Now look at the next pair of numbers, which is "60" and "80". Check to see what number is bigger.
Because the first number in the pair "60" is smaller than "80", do not swap them.
We have reached the final position in the array, and no swaps were made in that pass, so the array is sorted.
