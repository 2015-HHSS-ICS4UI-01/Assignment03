Bucket sort is not as useful as a general sorting algorithm because it is inefficient. The tracker array
must be checked in its entirety twice: once to set all numbers to 0, and again to go through the array
to sort the set of numbers given. With bigger sets, bucket sort's efficiency is O(n^2), equal to that
of bubble sort, a sorting method also not the most efficient.
