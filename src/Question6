Bucket sort is not as useful as a general sorting algorithm because it is inefficient. The tracker array
must be checked in its entirety twice: once to set all numbers to 0, and again to go through the array
to sort the set of numbers given. Although bucket sort is fine with large sets of numbers, with smaller
sets of numbers, the number of steps taken to sort is unnecessary.
