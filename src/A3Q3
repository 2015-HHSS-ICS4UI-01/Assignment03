The maximum number of comparisons that might be required to perform a binary search on a list containing seven items is 3.
This will happen if the number being looked for is at the start of the array or at the end of the array OR if it does not exist in the array.


Example Array = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}
    To find 1 the program will look at the number i the middle of array.
    Since the number is less than the number at the middle of array it will goto left of array.
    New Array = {1,2,3}
    Since the number is less than the number at the middle of array it will goto left of array.
    New Array = {1}
    Since they are not equal it will divide the array by two and go to the left of the array.
    Since this is the only number in the array and matches the number trying to be found, it will return this position.

    This takes 3 steps to do, also if the number was not in the array this many steps would still take place.
