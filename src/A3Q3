What is the maximum number of comparisons that might be required to perform a binary search on a list containing seven items?
Explain the situation and include an example of such a list and search.

The maximum number of comparisons that might be required is 
This number of comparisons is required when the searched item is first or last in the list.

Let's walk through the comparisons with an example list of numbers: 2, 3, 7, 10, 14, 15, 19
Suppose we are searching for the number 2, which is the first entry in the list.
Comparison 1: Go to the middle number, which is "10" and check if it's the number "2".
Since "10" is bigger than "2", separate and move to the left numbers.
Comparison 2: Go to the middle number, which is "3"
