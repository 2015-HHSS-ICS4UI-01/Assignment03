The maximum amount of comparisons in an array containing seven items is 
three comparisons. This only occurs when the number you want to find it at the beginning or the end of the array.
For example: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    Find 0.
    It will first compare 0 and 3.
    Since they are not equal it will divide the array by two and go to the left of the array.
    It will compare 0 and 1. 
    Since they are not equal it will divide the array by two and go to the left of the array.
    It will compare 0 and 0.
    Since they are equal, it will end the search.
So as a result, there are a total of three comparisons of an array containing 7 items.
