No, they would approximately be the same in terms of comparisons. In selection sort, it will go through the
whole array to determine which is the smallest number and place it in the first position of the array.
Then it will find the second smallest number and put it into the second place in the array and this 
process will continue until all the numbers are sorted. In insertion sort, it will go through every number
and compare it to the previous number. If the second number is smaller, the positions will swap.
Overall, in worst case scenarios, both of these sorting algorithms aren't the best. They both make the same many many comparisons.
