For large arrays, in the worst case, is selection sort faster than insertion sort? Explain.

In the worst case, selection sort and insertion sort will take the same amount of comparisons.
This is because, in the case where the array is sorted backwards, 
both algorithms will use the maximum number of comparisons, which is O(n^2).
Although in every case other than the worst, insertion sort is faster, 
because it only does the number of comparisons that are needed.
