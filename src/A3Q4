Yes Selection sort would be faster than insertion sort.
if you have a large array, insertion sort could lose itself by grouping up larger numbers at the beginning.
whereas selection sort moves the larger numbers to the end of the array (or vice versa), keeps all numbers heading in their respective end of the array.
