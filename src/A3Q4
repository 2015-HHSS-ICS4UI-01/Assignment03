Yes, selection sort would be a better search algorithm for large arrays 
in worst case scenarios. This is because insertion sort is best for small arrays. 
Insertion sort will keep shuffling down a number into its correctly sorted position.
This will take time to both find the next number and to shuffle it down to it's right position. 
In comparison, selection sort would not take as long to undergo this process. 
It will find the smallest number, put it in the first position and it will continue this process 
until the search ends. Overall, it will take less time, and comparisons to do a selection sort 
than an insertion sort.
