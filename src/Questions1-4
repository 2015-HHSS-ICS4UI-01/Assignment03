1) 23, 27, 30, 34, 41, 51, 55, 57, 60, 67, 72, 78, 83, 96

a) 72

Sequential Search:
program takes in two variables: an array of numbers and the number to find in the array (72)
searches through the array of numbers starting at position 0, until 72 is found or until all numbers have been seen
if 72 is found, return position of 72 in the array to the user
if not found, return -1 to the user
since 0 (23) is less than 72, program checks the next number
since 1 (27) is less than 72, program checks the next number
since 2 (30) is less than 72, program checks the next number
since 3 (34) is less than 72, program checks the next number
since 4 (41) is less than 72, program checks the next number
since 5 (51) is less than 72, program checks the next number
since 6 (55) is less than 72, program checks the next number
since 7 (57) is less than 72, program checks the next number
since 8 (60) is less than 72, program checks the next number
since 9 (67) is less than 72, program checks the next number
since 10 (72) is equal to the number the program was searching for, program returns its position, 10, to the user

Binary Search:

program takes in 4 variables: the array of numbers, the number to find, the starting position of the array and the ending position
if starting point is greater than the ending point, return -1 to the user
since starting point is less than the ending point, program tries to find the middle of the array instead
find the middle of the array by subtracting the starting point from the ending point, then dividing by 2
program subtracts 0 from 13, and divides that by 2 for an answer of 6.
the program begins to check the array starting at position 6.
if the number at position 6 of the array is equal to the number to be found, return the position number to the user
since number at 6 is 55, program instead checks if 55 is greater than or less than 72
since 55 is less than 72, program returns the same number to find, array, and ending point, but sets its start to 7 (the middle of the array (6) plus 1)
program subtracts 7 from 13 and divides by 2 for an answer of
