        Sequential search:  The program starts off by looking at the first position
                            in the array and if the number is equal to the number 
                            being looked for, then the program stops running and returns the position of 
                            where the number is found in the array. Otherwise, if the 
                            number that is being looked for is not found, then 
                            program would move on to the next position in the array 
                            and check if it is the number that is being looked for.

        a) Array = {23, 27, 30, 34, 41, 51, 55, 57, 60, 67, 72, 78, 83, 96} 

                            Position 1 - Is 23 = 72? No. The program moves on to the next position in the array.

                            Position 11 - Is 72 = 72? Yes. The program returns what position the number is found in the array.

                            Position 1 - Is 23 = 41? No. The program moves on to the next position in the array.
                            Position 2 - Is 27 = 41? No. The program moves on to the next position in the array.

                            Position 1 - Is 23 = 50? No. The program moves on to the next position in the array.
                            Position 2 - Is 27 = 50? No. The program moves on to the next position in the array. 
                            Position 3 - Is 30 = 50? No. The program moves on to the next position in the array. 
                            Position 4 - Is 34 = 50? No. The program moves on to the next position in the array. 
                            Position 5 - Is 41 = 50? No. The program moves on to the next position in the array. 
                            Position 6 - Is 51 = 50? No. The program moves on to the next position in the array. 
                            Position 7 - Is 55 = 50? No. The program moves on to the next position in the array. 
                            Position 8 - Is 57 = 50? No. The program moves on to the next position in the array. 
                            Position 9 - Is 60 = 50? No. The program moves on to the next position in the array. 
                            Position 10 - Is 67 = 50? No. The program moves on to the next position in the array.     
                            Position 11 - Is 72 = 50? No. The program moves on to the next position in the array.  
                            Position 11 - Is 78 = 50? No. The program moves on to the next position in the array.  
                            Position 11 - Is 83 = 50? No. The program moves on to the next position in the array.  
                            Position 11 - Is 96 = 50? No. The program moves on to the next position in the array.

                            The program returns that the number does not exist in the array.
                            
        Binary search:  The program starts off in the middle of the array and then checks if the number 
                        being searched for is bigger than or smaller than the number in the middle of the array.
                        If the number being searched for is bigger than the number in the middle of the array then 
                        the number is on the right side of the middle number. If the number being searched for is 
                        bigger than the number in the middle of the array then the number is on the right side of 
                        the middle number.
