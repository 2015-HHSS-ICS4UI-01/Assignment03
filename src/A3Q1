Suppose an array called scores contains the elements 23, 27, 30, 34, 41, 51, 55, 57, 60, 67, 72, 78, 83, 96
In an organized manner, trace the execution of Sequential Search and Binary Search Algorithms to search for the following elements:

a)72
Sequential Search
Check to see if the first element "23" is 72.
Since it is not 72, move onto the next number.
Check to see if the element "27" is 72.
Since it is not 72, move onto the next number.
Check to see if the element "30" is 72.
Since it is not 72, move onto the next number.
Check to see if the element "34" is 72.
Since it is not 72, move onto the next number.
Check to see if the element "41" is 72.
Since it is not 72, move onto the next number.
Check to see if the element "51" is 72.
Since it is not 72, move onto the next number.
Check to see if the element "55" is 72.
Since it is not 72, move onto the next number.
Check to see if the element "57" is 72.
Since it is not 72, move onto the next number.
Check to see if the element "60" is 72.
Since it is not 72, move onto the next number.
Check to see if the element "67" is 72.
Since it is not 72, move onto the next number.
Check to see if the element "72" is 72.
Since it is 72, the Sequential Search is complete.

Binary Search
Go to the middle element, which is "57" and check if it's 72.
Since "57" is smaller than 72, separate and move to the right elements.
Go to the middle element, which is "78" and check if it's 72.
Since "78" is bigger than 72, separate and move to the left elements.
Go to the middle element, which is "67" and check if it's 72.
Since "67" is smaller than 72, separate and move to the right elements.
Go to the middle element, which is "72" and check if it's 72.
Since it is 72, the Binary Search is complete.

b)41
Sequential Search
Check to see if the first element "23" is 41.
Since it is not 41, move onto the next number.
Check to see if the element "27" is 41.
Since it is not 41, move onto the next number.
Check to see if the element "30" is 41.
Since it is not 41, move onto the next number.
Check to see if the element "34" is 41.
Since it is not 41, move onto the next number.
Check to see if the element "41" is 41.
Since it is 41, the Sequential Search is complete.

Binary Search
Go to the middle element, which is "57" and check if it's 41.
Since "57" is bigger than 41, separate and move to the left elements.
Go to he middle element, which is "34" and check if it's 41.
Since "34" is smaller than 41, separate and move to the right elements.
Go to the middle element, which is "51" and check if it's 41.
Since "51" is bigger than 41, separate and move to the left elements.
Go to the middle element, which is "41" and check if it's 41.
Since it is 41, the Binary Search is complete.

c)50
Sequential Search
Check to see if the first element "23" is 50.
Since it is not 50, move onto the next number.
Check to see if the element "27" is 50.
Since it is not 50, move onto the next number.
Check to see if the element "30" is 50.
Since it is not 50, move onto the next number.
Check to see if the element "34" is 50.
Since it is not 50, move onto the next number.
Check to see if the element "41" is 50.
Since it is not 50, move onto the next number.
Check to see if the element "51" is 50.
Since it is not 50, move onto the next number.
Check to see if the element "55" is 50.
Since it is not 50, move onto the next number.
Check to see if the element "57" is 50.
Since it is not 50, move onto the next number.
Check to see if the element "60" is 50.
Since it is not 50, move onto the next number.
Check to see if the element "67" is 50.
Since it is not 50, move onto the next number.
Check to see if the element "72" is 50.
Since it is not 50, move onto the next number.
Check to see if the element "78" is 50.
Since it is not 50, move onto the next number.
Check to see if the element "83" is 50.
Since it is not 50, move onto the next number.
Check to see if the element "96" is 50.
Since it is not 50, move onto the next number.
Since there are no more numbers to check, the element 50 is not in the array.

Binary Search
Go to the middle element, which is "57" and check if it's 50.
Since "57" is bigger than 50, separate and move to the left elements.
Go to the middle element, which is "34" and check if it's 50.
Since "34" is smaller than 50, separate and move to the right elements.
Go to the middle element, which is "51" and check if it's 50.
Since "51" is bigger than 50, separate and move to the left elements.
Go to the middle element, which is "41" and check if it's 50.
Since "41" is smaller than 50, separate and move to the right elements.
Since there are no more numbers to check, the element 50 is not in the array.
