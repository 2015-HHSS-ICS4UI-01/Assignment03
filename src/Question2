2) 25, 30, 20, 80, 40, 60

Program creates a boolean equal to false, to use to check if numbers have been switched around.
Program starts at position 0, loops through every number in the array repeatedly, while numbers are being swapped.
If the number at the program's current position is greater than its position+1:
    Program saves its position's number to a temp variable, saves current position+1's number to the current position's number,
    then saves the temp variable to current position+1.
    Since 0 (25) is less than 1 (30), program checks the next number.
    Since 1 (30) is greater than 2 (20), program saves position 1 (30) to a temp variable, saves position 2 (20) to position 1,
        and saves the temp variable (30) to position 2.    
    Since 2 (30) is less than 3 (80), program checks the next number.
    Since 3 (80) is greater than 4 (40), program saves position 3 (80) to a temp variable, saves position 4 (40) to position 3,
        and saves the temp variable (80) to position 4.
    Since 4 (80) is greater than 5 (60), program saves position 4 (80) to a temp variable, saves position 5 (60) to position 4,
        and saves the temp variable (80) to position 5.
    Since 5 (80) is the end of the array, program ends current loop, but still needs to check for swapping.
If the boolean has been set to true, loop through the array again.
    Since the boolean is true, indicating a number swap was made, program loops through the entire array, {25, 20, 30, 40, 60, 80}, again.

If the number at the program's current position is greater than its position+1:
    Program saves its position's number to a temp variable, saves current position+1's number to the current position's number,
    then saves the temp variable to current position+1.
    Since 0 (25) is greater than 1 (20) program saves position 0 (25) to a temp variable, saves position 2 (20) to position 1,
        and saves the temp variable (25) to position 2.
    Since 1 (25) is less than 2 (30), program checks the next number.
    Since 2 (30) is less than 3 (40), program checks the next number.
    Since 3 (40) is less than 4 (60), program checks the next number.
    Since 4 (65) is less than 5 (80), program checks the next number.
    Since 5 (80) is the end of the array, program ends current loop, but still needs to check for swapping
If the boolean has been set to true, loop through the array again.
    Since the boolean is true, indicating a number swap was made, program loops through the entire array, {20, 25, 30, 40, 60, 80}, again.

If the number at the program's current position is greater than its position+1:
    Program saves its position's number to a temp variable, saves current position+1's number to the current position's number,
    then saves the temp variable to current position+1 .
    Since 0 (20) is less than 1 (25), program checks the next number.
    Since 1 (25) is less than 2 (30), program checks the next number.
    Since 2 (30) is less than 3 (40), program checks the next number.
    Since 3 (40) is less than 4 (60), program checks the next number.
    Since 4 (65) is less than 5 (80), program checks the next number.
    Since 5 (80) is the end of the array, program ends current looping, but still needs to check for swapping.
If the boolean has been set to true, loop through the array again.
    Since the boolean is set to false, the program stops looping through the array.
